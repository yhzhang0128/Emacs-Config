## Yunhao's Configuration of Emacs

### Introduction
I started to use emacs in my Program Language class for OCaml.
I find it very fancy so that I'd like to share my configurations.
I've ported these settings to both my Ubuntu and Mac OS X.
Language support issues can be found in `./yunhao/`

### Usage
```
  cd $HOME
  git clone https://github.com/yhzhang0128/Emacs-Config.git
  mv Emacs-Config .emacs.d
  cp .emacs.d/.emacs .emacs
```

### Note
* GNU Emacs24 is the version I use. Different versions may cause problems.
* OCaml installation requires `opam` and `merlin`
